# CLI-mediaplayer
this is a mini project glued together quickly while exploring the different ways to effeciently render images and videos on terminals and terminal emulators.
# How it works
the main idea behind this project is the fact that ANSI escape codes could be utilized to render text as fully opaque and gapless blocks (ie pixels) in compatible terminals.
# Dependencies
-opencv4 --its how the project deals with video and image files and processes them in order to later render them through ANSI.
# TLDR
this project is just glue code to extract pixel data and render it on the terminal through ANSI.
